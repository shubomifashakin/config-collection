# CONFIG-COLLECTION

A personal repository of configuration files for various tools and services I use across my infrastructure and development environments.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to serve as a centralized location for storing configuration files for tools and services I use for my projects. It is designed to make it easier to manage and maintain configuration files for multiple tools and services, and to ensure that they are consistent across different environments

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `grafana-alloy`: Configuration files for Grafana Alloy.
- `nginx`: Configuration files for Nginx.

and definitly more (as I use more tools and services)...
